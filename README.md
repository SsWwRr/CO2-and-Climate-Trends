# CO2-and-Climate-Trends
# Introduction
This project is focused on showcasing my PostgreSQL and Power BI skills. The repository is divided by their use into three main parts: 
Database Updates: Scripts for updating the databases to better suit my needs.
Data Queries: SQL queries to answer specific questions and extract relevant data.
Power BI Integration: Creation of smaller tables to be used in Power BI Desktop for visualization.

# QUESTIONS
QUESTION 1:What are the long-term trends in global temperature anoomaly changes over the years and are there any notable seasonal patterns in temperature changes?

ANSWER 1: Temperature anomaly rate over the decades has risen significantly,as for seasonal changes, the anomaly rate is the highest on average in fall and the lowest in summer. 

QUESTION 2:How do annual fossil fuel emissions compare to land-use change emissions?
QUESTION 3:How does cement carbonation contribute to the carbon budget?
QUESTION 4:How effective are the ocean and land sinks in absorbing CO2 emissions?

ANSWER 2:Average land use emissions are ~4 times smaller than the average fossil emissions.
ANSWER 3:Cement carbonation contribute around 1% to the sequestration of the CO2.
ANSWER 4:Land and ocean sinks take care of ~55% of the carbon in the atmosphere.

QUESTION 5:What is the trend in the budget imbalance over the years?

ANSWER 5:The budget imbalance has been volatile over the last 5 decades.

QUESTION 6:What are the long-term trends in melting ice areas for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?
QUESTION 7:Is there a correlation between global temperature anomaly changes and the area of melting ice in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ab0cc4-265f-429a-8b4b-a20fee0eab74)

ANSWER 6: Southern hemisphere has lost a lot of ice during the last decade while northern hemisphere has been steadily losing a similar amount of ice every decade.
ANSWER 7:As the anomaly rate is going up, the amount of ice lost is also getting higher
