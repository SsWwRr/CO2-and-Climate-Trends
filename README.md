# CO2-and-Climate-Trends
# Introduction
This project is designed to showcase my skills in PostgreSQL and Power BI by analyzing climate data related to CO2 emissions and global temperature trends. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to handle complex data analysis, data visualization, and database management.

| Technology Used	| Skills Demonstrated | 
| PostgreSQL | 	Complex Window Functions, Data Manipulation, Data Creation, Data Analysis | 
| Power BI | 	Data Visualization, Interactive Reporting, Data Analysis |
| PgAdmin4	| Database Creation, Data Entry, Query Optimization |
| Excel	| Data Manipulation, Data Cleaning |
The repository is organized into three main sections based on their functionality:
 * Database Updates: Contains scripts for updating and optimizing the database structure to better suit the analysis needs.
 * Data Queries: Includes SQL queries that extract and analyze specific data points, providing insights into climate trends.
 * Power BI Integration: Consists of smaller, optimized tables designed for use in Power BI Desktop to create compelling visualizations.

# Conclusion
# The data analyzed in this project provides compelling evidence that the Earth is experiencing significant warming. Long-term trends show a steady increase in global temperatures and a corresponding loss of ice in polar regions. The findings emphasize the urgent need for continued research and action to address climate change.

# Analysis and Insights

# QUESTIONS
QUESTION 1:What are the long-term trends in global temperature anoomaly changes over the years and are there any notable seasonal patterns in temperature changes?

Answer:
The data indicates a significant rise in temperature anomaly rates over the decades. Seasonal analysis reveals that the anomaly rate tends to peak during the fall and is lowest during the summer.

# QUESTION 2:How do annual fossil fuel emissions compare to land-use change emissions?

Answer:
On average, emissions from land-use changes are approximately four times smaller than those from fossil fuel consumption.

# QUESTION 3:How does cement carbonation contribute to the carbon budget?

Answer:
Cement carbonation accounts for around 1% of CO2 sequestration, playing a minor but noteworthy role in the overall carbon budget.

# QUESTION 4:How effective are the ocean and land sinks in absorbing CO2 emissions?

Answer:
The ocean and land sinks collectively absorb approximately 55% of the CO2 emissions, highlighting their critical role in mitigating atmospheric CO2 levels.

# QUESTION 5:What is the trend in the budget imbalance over the years?

Answer:
The budget imbalance has shown significant volatility over the past five decades, reflecting the dynamic and complex nature of global carbon budget calculations.

# QUESTION 6: What are the long-term trends in melting ice areas for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?

Answer:
The Southern Hemisphere has experienced a dramatic loss of ice in the last decade, while the Northern Hemisphere has been steadily losing a similar amount of ice each decade.

# QUESTION 7: Is there a correlation between global temperature anomaly changes and the area of melting ice in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?

Answer:
There is a clear correlation between rising temperature anomaly rates and increased ice loss in both hemispheres, with ice loss accelerating as temperatures rise.
